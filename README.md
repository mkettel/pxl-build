# PXL Blazor WebAssembly Application

## About
This project implements a call to a movie list API endpoint and displays the movies in a list format. There is a form for adding new movies to the list via POST request. I was debugging and viewing using localhost.

Note: I do have slightly updated styling on a new branch yet to push.
